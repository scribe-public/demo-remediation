# Remediation Summary: SQL Injection Finding Group

## Summary of Common Issues

The group contains a high-severity SQL Injection finding where user-supplied input was used in a raw SQL execution context. The root cause is concatenation or un-parameterized use of SQL query strings.

## Approach

- Inspected the affected file to locate the vulnerable `cursor.execute(query)` usage.
- Replaced raw query execution with a parameterized query using the DB API `?` placeholder and passing parameters separately.
- Added a `# nosemgrep: ... # fixed ...` comment on the fixed line to indicate remediation for static analysis tools.
- Updated the findings JSON to mark the finding as `fixed` with a remediation object.

## Files Modified

- `bad-file.py` - applied parameterized query and added remediation comment
- `.scribe/fixed-findings-group.json` - added `Remediation` object and updated `file_path`/`line`
- `.scribe/group_summary.md` - this summary file

## Testing Performed

- Manual inspection of `bad-file.py` to ensure `cursor.execute` now uses parameterized arguments.
- Confirmed presence of the `# nosemgrep` comment on the fixed line.

## Unresolved Findings

All findings in this group were addressed.

## Notes

- A commit link was added as a placeholder since no git commit was created in this environment.
