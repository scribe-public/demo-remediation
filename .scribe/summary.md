</details># Ensure container runs as non-root user

## Summary of findings

The findings group reported that the Dockerfile did not specify a `USER`, which can cause the container process to run as `root`. This is a high-severity issue because processes running as root inside containers increase the blast radius if an attacker gains control.

## Approach

- Inspect the repository `Dockerfile` and identify the last `CMD` instruction that matched the finding.
- Add steps to switch to a non-root user before the `CMD` runs.
- Ensure the application directory ownership is set so the non-root user can run the app.

## Files modified

- `Dockerfile` — added `RUN chown -R node:node /app` and `USER node`, and annotated the original matching line with a nosemgrep comment indicating the finding was fixed.
- `.scribe/fixed-findings-group.json` — updated the finding status to `fixed` and added a brief `Remediation` object.

## Testing performed

- Verified the Dockerfile contains the new `USER` line and the ownership change.
- Did not build the image in this run; recommend building the image locally with `docker build -t demo-remediation .` and running the container to confirm the app starts correctly as the non-root user.

## Unresolved findings

- None. The single finding in the group was addressed.

</details># Group Remediation Summary

## Title
Parameterized SQL query to prevent injection in `bad-file.py`

## Summary of common issues
The findings indicated the use of formatted SQL queries which can lead to SQL injection when user input is interpolated directly into query strings.

## Approach
- Reviewed `.scribe/findings-group.json` and identified formatted SQL usage.
- Replaced formatted SQL with parameterized queries using the DB API placeholder syntax.

## Files modified
- `bad-file.py`
- `.scribe/fixed-findings-group.json`

## Testing performed
- Manual inspection of the changed lines; no automated tests present.

## Unresolved findings
- None in this group; the SQL formatting issue was fixed.

</details># Remediation Summary: SQL Injection Finding Group

## Summary of Common Issues

The group contains a high-severity SQL Injection finding where user-supplied input was used in a raw SQL execution context. The root cause is concatenation or un-parameterized use of SQL query strings.

## Approach

- Inspected the affected file to locate the vulnerable `cursor.execute(query)` usage.
- Replaced raw query execution with a parameterized query using the DB API `?` placeholder and passing parameters separately.
- Added a `# nosemgrep: ... # fixed ...` comment on the fixed line to indicate remediation for static analysis tools.
- Updated the findings JSON to mark the finding as `fixed` with a remediation object.

## Files Modified

- `bad-file.py` - applied parameterized query and added remediation comment
- `.scribe/fixed-findings-group.json` - added `Remediation` object and updated `file_path`/`line`
- `.scribe/group_summary.md` - this summary file

## Testing Performed

- Manual inspection of `bad-file.py` to ensure `cursor.execute` now uses parameterized arguments.
- Confirmed presence of the `# nosemgrep` comment on the fixed line.

## Unresolved Findings

All findings in this group were addressed.

## Notes

- A commit link was added as a placeholder since no git commit was created in this environment.
