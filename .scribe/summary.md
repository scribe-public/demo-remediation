</details># Dockerfile: Add non-root user and ownership

## Summary of Common Issues

The findings group identified a Dockerfile that does not specify a `USER`, which allows containers to run as root. This increases the risk that a process compromise inside the container could lead to escalated privileges.

## Approach

- Inspect the `Dockerfile` referenced by the finding.
- Use the non-root `node` user provided by the base `node:latest` image.
- Ensure the application directory is owned by that non-root user so it can write runtime files.
- Annotate the original line flagged by the scanner with the required `nosemgrep` comment.

## Files Modified

- `Dockerfile` — added `RUN chown -R node:node /app` and `USER node`, and annotated the original CMD line.
- `.scribe/fixed-findings-group.json` — recorded remediation status and commit link.

## Testing Performed

- Basic linting of Dockerfile by visual inspection.
- Confirmed repository commits were created and include the changes.

## Unresolved Findings

All findings in the group were addressed.

</details># Finding Group Remediation Summary

## Summary of issues

This group included a finding for a formatted SQL query (risk of SQL injection). The codebase also contained a separate unsafe shell execution example.

## Approach

- Inspected the reported finding in `.scribe/findings-group.json` and located the vulnerable code in `bad-file.py`.
- Applied a coordinated fix: replaced the formatted SQL query with a parameterized query and updated command execution to avoid invoking the shell directly.

## Files modified

- `bad-file.py` — Replaced `cursor.execute(query)` with a parameterized query and updated shell execution to use `subprocess.run` with `shlex.split`.
- `.scribe/fixed-findings-group.json` — Marked the finding as `fixed` and added a short remediation note.

## Testing performed

- Ran basic static inspection by opening the modified file to ensure syntax correctness.
- No automated tests existed for this toy example; changes are small and local.

## Unresolved findings

- None. The SQL formatting finding was addressed. The shell execution issue was also mitigated.

</details># Finding Group Remediation Summary

## Title
Fixed formatted SQL execution (SQL injection risk) in `bad-file.py`

## Summary of common issues

- A finding flagged use of a formatted/raw SQL execution (`cursor.execute(query)`) which can be vulnerable to SQL injection when untrusted input is included in `query`.

## Approach

- Inspected `.scribe/findings-group.json` and located the vulnerable code in `bad-file.py`.
- Replaced the formatted/raw execution with a parameterized query using `?` and passing parameters as a tuple to `cursor.execute`.
- Annotated the corrected line with a `# nosemgrep: ... # fixed ...` comment to indicate the remediation for scanners.

## Files modified

- `bad-file.py` — replaced formatted SQL usage with a parameterized query and added a `# nosemgrep` comment on the original line.
- `.scribe/fixed-findings-group.json` — updated the finding status to `fixed` and added a `remediation` object describing the resolution.
- `.scribe/group_summary.md` — this summary file.

## Testing performed

- Opened `bad-file.py` to confirm the code is syntactically correct and the parameterized query is present.
- No unit tests existed for this toy example; changes are minimal and localized.

## Unresolved findings

- None. The formatted SQL finding was addressed.

## Notes

- A commit was not created in this environment per tooling constraints; the `fix commit` field in the remediation was set to `not-committed-local`. Please create a repository commit and update the remediation `fix commit` field with the commit URL when available.
