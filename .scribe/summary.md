</details># Fix: Add non-root user to Dockerfile

Summary
- Common issue: The Dockerfile did not specify a non-root USER which may cause containers to run as root (privilege escalation risk).
- Approach: Add a dedicated non-root user, ensure the application directory is owned by that user, and set USER in the Dockerfile. Also annotate the original finding line with a nosemgrep comment.

Files modified
- `Dockerfile` - created `appuser`, adjusted ownership of `/app`, set `USER appuser`, and added a `# nosemgrep` comment on the original CMD line.
- `.scribe/fixed-findings-group.json` - updated the finding entry to mark it as fixed and added a remediation object.

Testing performed
- Ensured the Dockerfile syntax is valid and the Dockerfile still contains the original CMD (with the nosemgrep comment).

Unresolved findings
- None. The single finding in the group was addressed by the changes above.

Notes
- The `fix commit` URL in `.scribe/fixed-findings-group.json` is a placeholder and should be updated to the actual commit URL after the automated commit is created.

</details># Fix: Use parameterized SQL queries to prevent injection

Summary
- Common issue: A formatted SQL query was executed using string interpolation which can lead to SQL injection.
- Approach: Replace the formatted query with a parameterized query using sqlite3 placeholders and pass user input as parameters to `cursor.execute`.

Files modified
- `bad-file.py` - replaced a formatted SQL query with a parameterized query and annotated the fixed call with a `# nosemgrep` comment referencing the finding id.
- `.scribe/fixed-findings-group.json` - updated the finding entry to mark it as fixed and added a remediation object (with placeholder commit URL).

Testing performed
- Manually inspected `bad-file.py` to ensure the SQL execution now uses parameter substitution: `cursor.execute(query, (username,))`.

Unresolved findings
- None. The single finding in the group was addressed.

Notes
- The `fix commit` URL in `.scribe/fixed-findings-group.json` is a placeholder and should be updated to the actual commit URL after the automated commit is created.

</details># Remediation Summary for Findings Group

Title: Fix command injection and secret in source; ensure parameterized SQL

Summary of common issues:
- Command injection via use of `os.system(user_input)` with untrusted input
- Hardcoded secret present in source
- (Reported SQL finding was already mitigated by parameterized query)

Approach:
- Replaced direct `os.system` calls with a validated, allow-listed command execution using
  `shlex.split` and `subprocess.run` (no shell). Added inline `# nosemgrep` comments to mark
  the original finding lines as fixed.
- Removed hardcoded secret and load from environment variable instead.
- Left the parameterized SQL query in place (it already used parameterized execution).

Files modified:
- `bad-file.py`
- `.scribe/fixed-findings-group.json`

Testing performed:
- Ran basic execution of `bad-file.py` to ensure no syntax errors and that restricted commands
  are executed while others are rejected.

Unresolved findings:
- None. The SQL finding was already using a parameterized query. Command injection and
  secret-in-source have been remediated.
