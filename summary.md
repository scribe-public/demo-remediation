# Remediation Summary

High-level summary:

- Updated package.json to set systeminformation to 5.23.7 (backup saved at .scribe/package.json.bak).
- npm was NOT available during remediation runs, so 'npm install' could not be executed by the automated script. This means package-lock.json and node_modules may still reference the old vulnerable version.
- node_modules directory is not present (dependencies not installed in this environment).

Detailed results for Critical/High vulnerabilities detected by grype:

| ID | Package | Severity | Detected Version (before) | Suggested Fix Version | Declared In | Fixed |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| GHSA-gx6r-qc2v-3p3v | systeminformation | Critical | 5.3.0 | 5.21.7 | package.json | ❌ |
| GHSA-2m8v-572m-ff2v | systeminformation | High | 5.3.0 | 5.3.1 | package.json | ❌ |
| GHSA-jff2-qjw8-5476 | systeminformation | High | 5.3.0 | 5.6.4 | package.json | ❌ |
| GHSA-cvv5-9h9w-qp2m | systeminformation | High | 5.3.0 | 5.23.7 | package.json | ❌ |

Notes:
- The script updated package.json dependency for systeminformation to 5.23.7. Backup: .scribe/package.json.bak
- npm was not available, so the dependency installation step was not performed. To complete remediation locally, run:

  1) Install Node.js and npm
  2) Run: npm install
  3) Re-run grype: grype dir:"$(pwd)" --output json --file vulnerabilities_after.json --sort-by severity
